			<p><strong>Doccle</strong> is Belgium’s biggest administration platform (2020). The principle is simple: create a free account or log in to add companies from which you want to receive your documents. Off to a paperless and easy administration!</p>

			<h2 class="main-h2">Users & Audience</h2>
			<p>The people that use Doccle, or Docclers as we call them, are between 18 to 65+ years old and need to be residents in Belgium. </p>
			<h2 class="main-h2">Problem</h2>
			<p>At Doccle, login questions have always been number one for our Customer Support Team.<br>Everyday 40% to 50% are login related questions, such as:<br>“How can I log in?”<br>“I forgot my password.”<br>“What’s the difference between a username and password?”<br>“I have no documents on my account.”<br>With some research, we were able to understand that these questions weren’t only related to the Login flow itself, but also to the Create Account one.</p>
			<h2 class="main-h2">Roles & Responsibilities</h2>
			<p>As usual, I worked as a UX and UI Designer and helped on the testing. This project involved the Customer Support Team, the Product Owner of our Web app and the best development team ♥️</p>

			<h2 class="main-h2">Scope & Constraints</h2>
			<p>Space on the roadmap was short. So this needed to be more of refactoring of the UI type of project than a UX improvement one. But thanks to the greatest development team and the help of a great Product Owner, we were able to do both, in a way.<br>During this project, we started to create our Design System and being responsive started to be mandatory instead of a nice to have.<br>By design, upon registration, Doccle asks for a username as a way to identify users. There are situations when the email address is used as a username, which is good (but not great), but that’s not always the case. In the future, we want to change this but for now, it’s something that we need to work with.</p>

					<img src="../img/doccledarkmode/03.png" alt="The image is a rectangle equally divided in two.

					<h5>Categories screen. Previous iOS version on the left and new version for iOS 13 on the right.</h5>
				</div>

			<h2 class="main-h2">Process</h2>
			<p>For a year the Customer Support Team would ask our Docclers for some behaviours hints, to understand how they were using the login and registration page. This is something that we still do today, applied to all issues. This helps a lot in understanding user behaviour while our user testing process is not very mature.</p>
			<h4>Problems found:</h4>
			<p>Most of our Docclers only go to Doccle when they get an email notification telling them that there’s a new document waiting for them. This can be a monthly invoice or an early tax document. So it’s only natural that some people don’t remember their passwords even if they already have an account on the platform.<br><br>Together with the fact that at the moment we identify users by username and not email address, this led to some unwanted double-accounts. Meaning that some Docclers would create an account to receive their taxes, and another for their telco invoice, for example. Naturally, this is a very frustrating situation to be in. Our users can easily become lost and confused because even though they just received an email indicating a new document is available, they don’t see all their documents on this new account accidentally created. The conclusion is easily drawn as “something is wrong with the platform” which normally generates a complaint. As you can imagine this is the type of issue that takes some time for Customer Service to really pinpoint the real root of the problem.<br><br>Another recurrent issue was autofill credentials. This sometimes led to confusion on shared family computers because it makes it easier to log in into wrong accounts.<br><br>For less tech-savvy Docclers more guidance was needed on the login process as well.</p>
			<figure class="w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width: 60%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="">
				<div>
					<img src="../img/doccledarkmode/04.png" alt="Four screens from the previous implementation. Here I want to show that each menu has its own color. Menu Scan and Pay is lime green, so the Call To Action on this screen is green as well as the colour used on the tab bar to show the select state. The same happens in all the other 3 screens. The Documents menu is light blue, the Connections menu is orange and finally the settings menu is yellow. The headers are all dark grey and the background of the screens is light grey, making the app feel quite heavy.">
					<h5>Different colours for all the different screens</h5>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>We then decided to go for one main colour on the doccle mobile application.<br>Blue was already a very much used colour on the doccle web app as well as on email communications and social media posts. So the challenge was only to find a similar tone that would fit light and dark mode in terms of readability and colour contrast. And "doccle-blue" was born! By doing this, we manage to keep the visual impact on our docclers to the minimum while unifying our user experience across our different platforms.</p>

				<div>
					<img src="../img/doccledarkmode/05.png" alt="Four screens aligned horizontally showing some empty screens First the empty screen for the Scan and Pay menu on the iOS version of the app. Here we see an icon of a black iOS phone, light mode version, scanning a blue invoice. Second, is an Android screen with a blue folder that contains white documents, this is the Documents’ empty screen. The third screen is again an Android example but now on dark mode, and shows the No internet connection screen. There’s a white icon of an Android phone that has a blue wi-fi icon inside. The wi-fi icon has a diagonal line on top to show that there’s no internet connection. Finally there’s another dark mode version of an empty screen, this time an iOS screen showing the Connections menu selected. The icon is blue and shows a user connecting to a company.">
					<h5>Final look & feel of some empty states</h5>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<br>
			<h4>Top bar</h4>
			<p>This was a tough one since a lot of our stakeholders considered the dark grey top bar to have a doccle feeling and part of the branding style.<br><br>It took quite some iterations on this but, in the end, everyone was happy with a light top bar for light mode and a dark top bar for dark mode as long as we managed to keep the rainbow present.<br><br>The rainbow is a very important element of doccle branding since the beginning of the company. It’s present across all our communications, internal and external and it’s also part of the company logo.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Small changes, big impact</h4>
			<p>The previous design was the same for iOS and Android, so, by changing to a more native look & feel we’ve reduced the learning curve and helped docclers feeling more confident to explore and use the doccle mobile app. By using native components we were also able to reduce implementation time and code maintenance. The headers and dropdown lists now have a more common feel for each OS and the background was changed from light grey to white, giving the app a more modern and light look.</p>

					<img src="../img/doccledarkmode/06.png" alt="With this image I intend to show that only by changing a dark grey top bar to a light one, the background from light grey to white and the cards to a list the feel that the new screens have is much more light and easy to scan the information. There’s three screens aligned horizontally, all from the Scan and Pay menu. First is the previous design, followed by the new design for iOS and then a last screen with the new design for Android.">

			<h4>From dropdown to tabs<br>Segment controls for iOS fellows 😉</h4>
			<p>“Not finding the Archive page” was one of the main reasons for bad ratings on the App and Play stores. The solution was to change the dropdown into two tabs: <i>Home</i> and <i>Archive</i>. Under <i>Archive</i> docclers can find all their documents, while on <i>Home</i> there’s a first section with <i>Urgent documents</i> meaning documents that require any action from users like pay or e-sign. Followed by the <i>New documents</i> section, where all newer documents are grouped and ordered by received date. After 2 months these documents are only available under the <i>Archive</i> tab. Finally, <i>To handle</i> is the last section under <i>Home</i>.</p>

			<h4>Filters</h4>
			<p>The major improvement on the <i>Filters</i> screen was the redesign of the tags. The flow of the screen was also improved, by having the search input followed by the date range input and only then by the tags. The tags section is composed by the <i>Partners</i> group, which is populated with all the companies that the user is connected with. Next, at the <i>Categories</i> group, we find the tags created by the user.<br><br>Previously, when a tag was selected, you could barely notice the difference, even if you are not a visually impaired person. To avoid this the tags have now icons before the labels that change depending on their select state. So now everyone can understand the difference between the two states of the tags, regardless of vision, device screen and tech-savviness. We also reduced the click error by making the tags bigger, in height and width.<br><br>There’s much work still to be done around tags, but for now, this is the result 😊</p>

			<h4>Introduction cards</h4>
			<p>The introduction cards are meant to give a first general overview of what is doccle and what you can do on the app. The illustrations were re-thought for a more accurate explanation of the doccle features and to get a more simple and modern look & feel. The use of the entire screen is to get users more focused on the explanation than on the dimmed background.</p>
