			<p>Project for GAU (Urban Art Gallery). GAU is a space for creative freedom dedicated by the city of Lisbon to graffiti and street art.<br><br>This was my intervention for the 9th edition of "Reciclar o olhar | A recycled look". I've used spray cans and markers, which are some of the materials that I like to work with the most on outdoor interventions.<br><br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/galeriadearteurbana/about/" target="_blank">See more photos of all interventions from the 9th edition</a>. You can find out more about GAU on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/galeriadearteurbana/about/" target="_blank">their Facebook page</a>. And see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/galeriadearteurbana/photos/a.527914030563059/533194116701717/?type=3&theater" target="_blank">the work of Carolina Quintinho</a>, she intervented on the same glass recycling bin as I did but on the 5th edition.<br><br>I really like origami. I always try to do some fancy thing with napkins for special occasions. I do little Santas on Christmas, to spread around the house. And of course, when I see some tutorial on Pinterest I always have to try it out … 🙈<br>So, when coming up with a concept for this intervention I immediately thought that origami and recycling were related. I mean, origami is giving a new life to a sheet of paper after all,right? 🤓<br></p>

			<p>The idea is that Tobias is getting rid of some old bottles on one side and on the other side new nature shaped life is popping out.<br>I used a lot of bright colours because I wanted to make people smile when passing by, I wanted to give a good feeling to the street even on rainy days, when you really need to go to the bottle bank...and you really really don’t want to… 🌈</p><br>

			<p>By now you’re thinking “Yeah yeah who cares, why is the character named Tobias?”<br>I’m glad you ask!<br>I like the name… And it was my name before my mom found out that she was going to have a girl instead… 🤷‍♀️ So yeah, Tobias is my go-to name, because...why not? </p>
