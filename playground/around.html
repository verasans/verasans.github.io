			<p>Around the World is a series of illustrations from some countries that I've visited so far.<br><br>I once had a project in Dubai and needed to move there for 3 months. So, out of nostalgia and to pass some time, I started looking at photographs from previous travel experiences and sketching funny moments that I remembered from those trips. The natural next step for me was adding the sketches to the photos.<br><br>I started to draw the characters on paper with pen or marker and then post-editing them on the pictures. Now, I draw directly (digitally) on the photographs or I start on paper, because I really like the paper and pen feel, and finish it digitally.<br><br>Itâ€™s not the goal of this project to have a consistent illustration style since this series spans through multiple years of my life. Personally, I also find it interesting to see the evolution of the style and the technique throughout the years in this series.<br></p>
