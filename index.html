      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          With over 10 years of experience in UI/UX design, I specialise in
          creating user-centred and accessible solutions, from wire-framing
          and design drafts to visual design and translating research into
          high-fidelity UI.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a strong background in UX research, including usability
          testing and stakeholder interviews, and I collaborate closely
          with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless integration of
          design in agile environments.

        <h2>AI Policy Assistant</h2>
