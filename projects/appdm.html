			<h2 class="main-h2">Overview</h2>
			<p><strong>What's doccle?</strong><br>doccle is Belgium‚Äôs biggest administration platform (2020). The principle is simple: create a free account or log in to add companies from which you want to receive your documents. Off to a paperless and easy administration!<br><br>When I first downloaded the doccle app, for my job interview, I had some issues finding my way around it. Considering myself a tech-savvy person I found this very unsettling so I went to read the user reviews on Google Play Store and on the App Store. The low ratings had a common theme: not user-friendly, very unusable, complex app, ‚Ä¶<br><br>Let‚Äôs do thisüí™</p>

			<h2 class="main-h2">Problem</h2>
			<p>At doccle we were all aware of a much-needed enhancement of UI and UX on our (mobile) apps. Besides, user feedback stated that doccle wasn‚Äôt very easy to understand and only tech-savvy users could find their way within the app. A big concern was also the accessibility of the app especially regarding the colour contrast and clickable areas. This needed to change since doccle is meant to help everyone, regardless of context, ability, or situation.<!--, not only younger generations starting to deal with administration related paperwork, but also help elderly people to feel that they have control on their administration for as long as possible.--></p>
			<h2 class="main-h2">Users & Audience</h2>
			<p>The people that use doccle, or docclers as we call them, have between 18 to 65+ years old and need to be residents in Belgium. Doccle needs to be straightforward, intuitive and easy to navigate for the tech-savvy docclers but also for the not so techy. It‚Äôs a challenge to find a solution that suits all as the needs of information, guidance and context are distinct.</p>
			<h2 class="main-h2">Roles & Responsibilities</h2>
			<p>I worked on this project as a UX and UI designer and, later on, as a tester. For the implementation phase, I worked with two external developers (Android and iOS) that have been collaborating with doccle for some time, mostly remote. We also had a Product Owner that also tested the app later on.</p>

			<h2 class="main-h2">Scope & Constraints</h2>
			<p>The initial goal of this project was just to be dark mode compatible on the iOS app due to some restrictions from Apple.<br><br>These restrictions came as the best news of 2019 for me and the mobile dev team. Since I‚Äôve joined the Doccle team that I always wanted to improve the experience and look and feel of the apps. But we are such a small team, and I‚Äôm a design team of one, that it‚Äôs impossible to stop and focus only on the redesign of the apps (web and mobile). My strategy was to always have a small improvement UX or UI wise in almost every release. Why ALMOST every release? Well, I‚Äôm glad you ask :) The developers were dealing with a lot of legacy code so a small visual improvement for design could turn out to be a big effort for development and/ or testing. So this needed to be kept in mind.<br><br>To help convince the stakeholders to broaden the scope I came up with a detailed plan, with the help of the dev team, and a roadmap proposal. The goal was to show them that we need to take this as an opportunity to improve both our mobile apps, because we‚Äôll don‚Äôt get that chance any time soon.<br><br>The plan showed that, since there was a lot of legacy code, whose complexity and lack of documentation would largely increase the implementation time, we could go for a more native look & feel while removing and improving some existing flows. This will not only help the users‚Äô navigation but also make life easier for our developers and, later on, testers. When working on the iOS screens of the project I immediately started to do the same for Android. This was really helpful for the stakeholders to understand how this would benefit our users and that we needed to include these improvements also for Android on the roadmap.<br><br>This project took around 3 months. It was a hard deadline since other features had more priority on the roadmap. Therefore, a close collaboration with the development team was crucial to make sure we could tackle the improvements that would fit our time-frame while already preparing the way for the most time-consuming enhancements down the line.<br><br>Developing for Android is a challenge. Most of this challenge comes from the multitude of Android versions still running on devices worldwide. In this specific project, for example, we are aiming for the current Android version, which is 10, but we still need to support all the way to Android 5 because a lot of doccle users still run on it. This creates limitations for me as a designer, but also for the Android developer. Therefore we had many iterations to figure out how to deliver a good solution. In this case, to define a good solution would mean to still carry the doccle-feeling and good user experience. As for older Android versions we were aiming to keep having a quick feeling app without compromising much on the features and look & feel.</p>

			<p>
			<!-- I know, I know this is not a list...-->
			‚ù£ Go through all the comments on the App Store and Google Play Store (again);<br>
			‚ù£ Gather information from all my co-workers from every department (support, development, sales, ‚Ä¶). It‚Äôs amazing the feedback that everyone has, from friends, family, potential partners and already doccle partners. By doing this, I get their feedback as doccle employees and as doccle users;<br>
			‚ù£ Analyse all the flows and see what we can remove or improve;<!--For example, there were multiple flows and ways to log-in or create an account within the app, so definitely room for improvement;--><br>
			‚ù£ Start designing, with weekly feedback from the development team regarding implementation times of the proposed changes;<br>
			‚ù£ Ask for feedback from colleagues and do small user testing sessions with them (at the time we were struggling to find a solution to do user testing with doccle users that are not doccle employees);<br>
			‚ù£ Support the developers during implementation;<br>
			‚ù£ Test away!

			<h2 class="main-h2">Some details</h2>
			<h4>doccle blue</h4>
			<p>Previously the doccle app had a different colour for each menu, which represented a huge challenge for our accessibility first approach. First things first! We needed to understand if these different colours were relevant to our docclers‚Äô navigation. According to the support team, and from the reviews from App and Play stores, we were able to understand that the users were always referring to the screen they were on by its title and not by its accent colour.</p>
			<figure class="w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width: 60%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="">
				<div>
					<img src="../img/doccledarkmode/04.png" alt="Four screens from the previous implementation. Here I want to show that each menu has its own color. Menu Scan and Pay is lime green, so the Call To Action on this screen is green as well as the colour used on the tab bar to show the select state. The same happens in all the other 3 screens. The Documents menu is light blue, the Connections menu is orange and finally the settings menu is yellow. The headers are all dark grey and the background of the screens is light grey, making the app feel quite heavy.">
					<h5>Different colours for all the different screens</h5>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>We then decided to go for one main colour on the doccle mobile application.<br>Blue was already a very much used colour on the doccle web app as well as on email communications and social media posts. So the challenge was only to find a similar tone that would fit light and dark mode in terms of readability and colour contrast. And "doccle-blue" was born! By doing this, we manage to keep the visual impact on our docclers to the minimum while unifying our user experience across our different platforms.</p>

Second, is an Android screen with a blue folder that contains white documents, this is the Documents‚Äô empty screen. The third screen is again an Android example but now on dark mode, and shows the No internet connection screen. There‚Äôs a white icon of an Android phone that has a blue wi-fi icon inside. The wi-fi icon has a diagonal line on top to show that there‚Äôs no internet connection. Finally there‚Äôs another dark mode version of an empty screen, this time an iOS screen showing the Connections menu selected. The icon is blue and shows a user connecting to a company.">

			<br>
			<h4>Top bar</h4>
			<p>This was a tough one since a lot of our stakeholders considered the dark grey top bar to have a doccle feeling and part of the branding style.<br><br>It took quite some iterations on this but, in the end, everyone was happy with a light top bar for light mode and a dark top bar for dark mode as long as we managed to keep the rainbow present.<br><br>The rainbow is a very important element of doccle branding since the beginning of the company. It‚Äôs present across all our communications, internal and external and it‚Äôs also part of the company logo.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Small changes, big impact</h4>
			<p>The previous design was the same for iOS and Android, so, by changing to a more native look & feel we‚Äôve reduced the learning curve and helped docclers feeling more confident to explore and use the doccle mobile app. By using native components we were also able to reduce implementation time and code maintenance. The headers and dropdown lists now have a more common feel for each OS and the background was changed from light grey to white, giving the app a more modern and light look.</p>

					<img src="../img/doccledarkmode/06.png" alt="With this image I intend to show that only by changing a dark grey top bar to a light one, the background from light grey to white and the cards to a list the feel that the new screens have is much more light and easy to scan the information.

First is the previous design, followed by the new design for iOS and then a last screen with the new design for Android.">

			<h4>From dropdown to tabs<br>Segment controls for iOS fellows üòâ</h4>
			<p>‚ÄúNot finding the Archive page‚Äù was one of the main reasons for bad ratings on the App and Play stores. The solution was to change the dropdown into two tabs: <i>Home</i> and <i>Archive</i>. Under <i>Archive</i> docclers can find all their documents, while on <i>Home</i> there‚Äôs a first section with <i>Urgent documents</i> meaning documents that require any action from users like pay or e-sign. Followed by the <i>New documents</i> section, where all newer documents are grouped and ordered by received date. After 2 months these documents are only available under the <i>Archive</i> tab. Finally, <i>To handle</i> is the last section under <i>Home</i>.</p>

			<br>
			<h4>Filters</h4>
			<p>The major improvement on the <i>Filters</i> screen was the redesign of the tags. The flow of the screen was also improved, by having the search input followed by the date range input and only then by the tags. The tags section is composed by the <i>Partners</i> group, which is populated with all the companies that the user is connected with. Next, at the <i>Categories</i> group, we find the tags created by the user.<br><br>Previously, when a tag was selected, you could barely notice the difference, even if you are not a visually impaired person. To avoid this the tags have now icons before the labels that change depending on their select state. So now everyone can understand the difference between the two states of the tags, regardless of vision, device screen and tech-savviness. We also reduced the click error by making the tags bigger, in height and width.<br><br>There‚Äôs much work still to be done around tags, but for now, this is the result üòä</p>

			<h4>Introduction cards</h4>
			<p>The introduction cards are meant to give a first general overview of what is doccle and what you can do on the app. The illustrations were re-thought for a more accurate explanation of the doccle features and to get a more simple and modern look & feel. The use of the entire screen is to get users more focused on the explanation than on the dimmed background.</p>
